# Acceptable Use

Ecstatic Sites is a service that hosts content uploaded by other people, and as such needs a policy so those people (you) can know what is and isn't okay (or legal) to host on Ecstatic.

The need for this stems from the following facts:

* Ecstatic uses Bunny CDN to distribute sites
* Bunny CDN has their own policy for what they will and won't host

So, for now, I'm going to put a link here to Bunny's Acceptable Use Policy, tell you to read that, and say the policy of Ecstatic is the same! This is subject to change but seems like a good starting point.

[Bunny CDN Acceptable Use Policy](https://bunny.net/acceptable-use/)

If you attempt to publish a site using Ecstatic which is in violation of this policy, please expect it to be taken down.
