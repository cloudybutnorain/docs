# Potentially Asked Questions

### Should I use Ecstatic?

It depends!

If you are a business (or otherwise need to rely on Ecstatic in a critical way), then probably not quite yet. I'm doing my best for reliability, but I'm specifically **making no promises yet** around things like availability of the Ecstatic UI or durability of the analytics data.

If you are running a less-critical site, and are OK with trying something that is still a bit experimental and work-in-progress, then sure, give it a try! I've been hosting several of my own sites ([my blog](https://www.willett.io/), [the landing page](https://www.ecstaticsites.org/)) on Ecstatic for several months now without issue.

### Does Ecstatic cost money?

Not right now, no.

As stated above, I'm not yet ready to take the kind of stance around stability that would be required for me to feel comfortable taking folks' money for this service. Consider it pre-1.0 and set your expectations accordingly.

### Will Ecstatic ever cost money?

Probably!

I want this service to be sustainable, something people can rely on existing for a long time, and giving away stuff for free which can get pretty expensive (like the dedicated servers and the CDN bandwidth) doesnâ€™t seem like a great way to accomplish that. Charging a monthly fee is also a great way to deter bad actors from trying to misuse the service.

On the other hand, my goal with Ecstatic is not to get rich -- I'll just be happy if it makes enogh to keep its own lights on. So when Ecstatic is ready and I want to start charging for its use, not only will I give as much advance notice as possible, but the pricing will also be a couple of dollars per month at most.
