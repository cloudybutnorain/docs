# Potentially Asked Questions

### Should I use CBNR?

It depends!

If you are a business (or otherwise need to rely on CBNR in a critical way), then probably not quite yet. I'm doing my best for reliability, but I'm specifically **making no promises yet** around things like availability of the CBNR UI or durability of the analytics data.

If you are running a less-critical site, and are OK with trying something that is still a bit experimental and work-in-progress, then sure, give it a try! I've been hosting several of my own sites ([my blog](https://www.willett.io/), [the landing page](https://www.cbnr.xyz/)) on CBNR for several months now without issue.

### Does CBNR cost money?

Not right now, no.

As stated above, I'm not yet ready to take the kind of stance around stability that would be required for me to feel comfortable taking folks' money for this service. Consider it pre-1.0 and make your expectations accordingly.

### Will CBNR ever cost money?

Maybe! I'm not sure yet.

The kinds of things I'm attempting to do with CBNR do cost me money to run (like the dedicated servers and the CDN bandwidth), and this is why similar site-hosting services usually also cost money (if they provide the same features as CBNR, anyway).

So, I might try to charge a nominal amount of money every month someday, or maybe I'll set up a donation page and hope that brings in enough to keep the lights on, or maybe CBNR will never really become popular enough that it becomes an issue. We'll find out together!
