# Potentially Asked Questions

### Does CBNR cost money?

Not right now, no.

The whole thing is still very much a work-in-progress, and although I've been hosting several of my own sites ([my blog](foo), [the landing page](foo)) on CBNR for several months without issue, I'm not yet ready to take the kind of stance around stability and foo that would be required for me to feel comfortable taking folks' money for this service. Consider it pre-1.0.

### Will CBNR ever cost money?

Maybe! I'm not sure yet.
