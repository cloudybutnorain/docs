# Creating a New Site

Site creation is handled via the CBNR web interface located at `app.cbnr.xyz`.

If you've already created a site, see [Publishing to a Site](./publishing.md) instead!

### Prerequisites

All you need is an account with Cloudy But No Rain. To create one, click [here](https://app.cbnr.xyz/#/signup).

### Creating the Site

To create a site, just head to the site-creation page of CBNR, located at the top of the sidebar (or the link [here](https://app.cbnr.xyz/#/create) should take you right to it if you're logged in).

Then, enter a "nickname" for your site. This name won't be visible to people visiting your site; it's only shown to you within the CBNR interface, so it can be whatever you want. It can also be changed later.

Then, click the `Create` button at the bottom of the page. If the site creation was successful, you'll be presented with a confirmation page including some more information.

Your site is now live on the web, and you can visit it!

### Configuring the Site

A site created with CBNR should be ready to use right away, without needing further configuration.

However, there are some options available to change after site creation, like changing the nickname and setting the path to the `index.html` of the site.

To update these settings, select your site using the overview page (located [here](https://app.cbnr.xyz/#/sites) if you're logged in), then click `Settings` in the sidebar.
